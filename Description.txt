
Summary: Write code that consumes a YAML file, increments any embedded version
numbers in a variety of ways, and outputs the changed file.

You may use any language, libraries or tools you want, as long as you will be
able to demonstrate your solution in person. Code that you can email to the
interviewers ahead of time usually works best, but other means of
demonstration, such as a laptop with the necessary tools loaded, would be fine
as well.

(Please confirm that we've received your code submission, since our email
 gateway will often remove attachments. We've found a public GitHub repository
 to be the safest bet.)

Input Specification: YAML file; see included "example.yaml"

       Note: Don't rely on the specific structure of the included example, be
       prepared to auto-detect version strings or take YAML key names/patterns
       as an argument.

Output Specification: Generate a YAML file that is the same as the input,
       except with version numbers changed. Include provisions for how to
       increment the version numbers (major, minor, release, filtering by key
       name, etc.).

Be prepared to discuss:

    Testing strategies
    Difficulties you had and how you solved them

Suggestion:

    Your code should be correct first, have good style and comments second, and
    then be clever/fast as a distant third.
